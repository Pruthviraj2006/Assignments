     <p><b>Global Education Challenges</b></p>
     <p><i>UNESCO and the World Bank are challenging education systems to address key issues of education and break the learning crisis for a brighter future for humanity.
        In the report, “Reimagining Our Futures Together: a New Social Contract for Education,” UNESCO (2021) points out climate change, democratic backsliding, growing social 
        inequality, and growing social fragmentation as the four key issues on which all countries must center their education systems.</i></p>
