<p>Vikram Batra, a spirited young officer of the Indian Army, was known for his infectious enthusiasm and unwavering courage. During the Kargil War in 1999, he led his troops into some of the most treacherous terrain, determined to reclaim Indian territory from entrenched enemy positions.

One pivotal moment came during the battle for Point 5140. Despite the relentless gunfire and harsh conditions, Batra's indomitable spirit inspired his men. With the battle raging, he famously exclaimed, "Either I will come back after raising the Indian flag, or I will not come back at all."

In a daring assault, he scaled the heights and engaged the enemy with unmatched valor. His strategic brilliance and fearless actions resulted in the capture of the point, turning the tide in favor of his battalion.

Tragically, Vikram Batra paid the ultimate price, but his legacy lived on. His bravery not only secured a strategic victory but also inspired countless Indians, embodying the spirit of sacrifice and patriotism. To this day, he is remembered as a true hero who laid down his life for his country, leaving behind a legacy of courage and honor.
